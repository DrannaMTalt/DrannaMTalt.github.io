About LilRena: LilRena is a game about a "cube-shaped hamster" with a purple top hat exploring an abandoned building that is 36 floors deep, but beware, the harmful dust in the building will slowly decrease your health! so you have to be careful.

Do not get a HTML file of a LilRena version from a site you don't trust. Only get them from here: [https://github.com/DrannaMTalt/LilRena_versions]
(I know this game is a bit boring, I felt like making LilRena because I was just bored)
