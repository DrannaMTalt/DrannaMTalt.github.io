The official LilRena repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the repository that holds the current LilRena version. Access LilRena here: [https://drannamtalt.github.io]

LilRena is a game about exploring a mysterious abandoned building that is 36 floors deep, but beware, the harmful dust in the building will slowly decrease your health! so you have to be fast in getting to the trapdoor.

Do not get a HTML file of a LilRena version from a site you don't trust. Only get them from here: [https://github.com/DrannaMTalt/LilRena_versions]

(I know this game is a bit boring, I made this project because I wanted to make an attempt to remake an old project of mine called "RenaYa")
